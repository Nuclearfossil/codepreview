# codepreview
Windows Code Preview tool

This is a windows Explorer (Windows 7) plugin that supports previewing code in an explorer pane.

The goal was to be able to browse code, in your file explorer and preview the file like you can with bitmaps, images and so on.

It's a bit of an old codebase - not sure if it'll even run on Windows 10.  I'll probably investigate that soonish.
